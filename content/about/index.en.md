## About This Site

The blog was originally created in the summer of 2016 and is currently generated by Hugo, hosted on GitHub Pages.

My native language is not English, so there are many posts that I can't translate into English.

## About Me

I'm an Arch Linux user who has a fondness for Linux. I frequently write code and hacking some interesting, abstract concepts.

In my spare time, I occasionally do photography. Photos are available on the [gallery](/en/gallery/) page.
